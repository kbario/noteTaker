## Description
noteTaker is a full-stack project that provides a UI in the browser that allows you to create and take notes, and then saves them on the back end.

This app is quite basic, only utilising one api route but uses three RESTful methods, being:

 - **Get**
 - **Post**, and
 - **Delete**

From this, users can create, and delete notes, as well as view existing notes.

noteTaker was created to be able to take efficient notes as well as to strengthen my full-stack skills.

From developing noteTaker, I have developed greater skills in back-end developement as well as with Express.js.

noteTaker was created with JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js.

### Taking a Note

On the note-taking page, you will see 'Note Title', and 'Note Text'. These are the input fields where you can name the note and give it a body. Once you are happy with your note and do not want to change it in anyway, click the save icon in the top right. This button commits the note to memory and you will see the title appear in the left-hand-side column. To delete this note, click the red garbage bin button on the right of the note you want to delete.
